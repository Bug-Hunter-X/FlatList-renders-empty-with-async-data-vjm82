This repository contains a React Native component that fetches data asynchronously and renders it using FlatList.  The initial implementation contains a bug where the FlatList remains empty even after successful data fetching.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle asynchronous operations and display data or error messages appropriately.  The bug is in the data fetching and handling within the component's lifecycle.
